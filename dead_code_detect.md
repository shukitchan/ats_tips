Detecting Dead Code in Lua
==========================

We can run luacov (https://github.com/lunarmodules/luacov) in production in a extremely small percentage over a long time and retrieve the code coverage information. 
This will then show the code that never gets run (i.e. dead code)
These are potential candidates to be removed as tech debt.

Example TBD.
